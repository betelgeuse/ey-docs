# Monitoring with Pingdom

## Why Pingdom

Pingdom is a great external tool for monitoring your appâ€™s up-time. Pingdom can provide you with phone and email alerts if your site goes down as well as graphs of your response time. They offer both free a paid accounts, so you can try their service before you buy it.

## Getting started 

To get started head over to pingdom.com and setup an account.

Although you could check the uptime of your homepage, it is generally not a good idea for a few reasons. Firstly, your homepage may have external dependencies which will make loading the page take longer and not accurately reflect your site's response time. Moreover, if one of these dependencies goes down it may bring your homepage down even if the rest of your app is still functioning correctly. Also, pinging your homepage creates more load on an already heavily trafficked part of your app. The better practice is to ping a less commonly visited page or use a tool like fitterhappier to create a page just for tracking uptime.
