# IP addresses on Cloud

Engine Yard Cloud uses Amazon AWS [[ Elastic IP Addresses|http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/]]. 
Each Cloud account is initially allotted 5 IP addresses to associate with your 
environments.

### Additional IP Addresses

If you need to request extra IP addresses, you can [[submit a ticket|http://support.cloud.engineyard.com]] 
and we'll make the proper requests to Amazon to provision more IP addresses for your account.
**Note:** This process generally takes 24 - 72 hours.
