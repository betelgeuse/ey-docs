* [[Sinatra|https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra]]
* [[Rails 2|https://github.com/rails/rails]]

## Framework Environment 

This is the type of environment for your application. This will set the `RAILS_ENV`, `MERB_ENV`, or `RACK_ENV` that will be used by the application.

## Ruby Runtime 

Choose the version of Ruby that is needed for your application. Currently we offer Ruby 1.8.6, Ruby 1.8.7, and REE. In our Beta program, we are offering [Ruby 1.9.2]() and [JRuby]().

## Web Server Stack

Choose the Web Server Stack that best suits your application.

* [[Passenger|http://www.modrails.com/]] - This is great for multi-application environments.
* [[Mongrel|https://github.com/fauna/mongrel]] - For most applications, this is the tried and true old standby. However, this **will not work** for Rails 2.3.8+ or Rails 3.
* [[Passenger 3|http://www.modrails.com/]] - This is currently in our Beta program. Visit [here]() for more information and to sign up.
