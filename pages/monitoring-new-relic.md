# Monitor applications with New Relic on AppCloud

[New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) is a tool for monitoring real-time web application performance â€” from the end-user experience down to a line of application code. 

You get real data about your users. For example, you can see what countries your 
users are in, what browsers they use, how long they wait for pages to download. You 
also get trending data; is your application faster or slower this week than last 
week? When problems occur, you can get a transaction response performance breakdown 
and view a detailed timeline of an individual request.    

**Note:** New Relic Standard is free for AppCloud customers.

### Steps to setup New Relic:

1. [Choose a New Relic plan] [1]
2. [Configure your application for monitoring] [2]
3. [View New Relic performance data for your application] [3]

<h2 id="topic1"> Choose a New Relic plan</h2>

The first task in setting up New Relic is to choose the plan you want. The 
Standard plan is free with your Engine Yard account. But, you might decide 
that the Professional plan better suits you needs. 

### To choose a New Relic plan

  1. Login to your account.
  2. Click Account > Account Settings on the toolbar.
  3. Click your account name.

  4. Click Manage your New Relic plan under the Services section.

  5. Choose the Standard plan or the Professional plan.
  6. Read and agree to the New Relic Terms of Service and select the check box. 
  7. Click Activate New Relic to activate your plan.

Your New Relic account is created automatically using your Engine Yard account and password. 

If you selected the Professional plan, the New Relic charge appears on your AppCloud 
account bill. You will not get a separate bill from New Relic.
