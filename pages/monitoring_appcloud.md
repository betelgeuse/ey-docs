# Monitoring Your Instances on AppCloud

AppCloud can monitor your instances for CPU usage, free space, etc. so that you're aware of extreme resource usage when it happens. 

We offer and recommend an External Monitoring For a Rails App|external URL monitor checking service to alert you if, after two consecutive attempts, if we have not been able to contact your URL with an HTTP 200 OK response.

**NOTE: If you are on one of Engine Yard's Support Plans, having alerts and monitoring enabled will allow them to be informed about your environments. This is not automatically done, so please enable alerts and monitoring for all supported environments.**
